    PRESENCE: Monitoring and Modelling the Performance Metrics of Mobile Cloud SaaS Web Services
    ~~~~~~~~

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are defining the quality of the services
delivered from the Cloud Services Providers (CSPs) to the cloud customers. The
services are delivered on a pay-per-use model. The quality of the provided
services are not guaranteed by the SLA because it is just a contract. The
developments around mobile cloud computing and the advent of edge computing
technologies are contributing to the diffusion of the cloud services and the
multiplication of offers. Although the cloud services market is growing for the
coming years, unfortunately, there is no standard mechanism which exists to
verify and assure that delivered services satisfy the signed SLA agreement in an
automatic way. The accurate monitoring and modelling of the provided Quality of
Service (QoS) is also missing. In this context, we aim at offering an automatic
framework named PRESENCE, to evaluate the QoS and SLA compliance of Web Services
(WSs) offered across several CSPs. Yet unlike other approaches, PRESENCE aims at
quantifying in a fair and by stealth way the performance and scalability of the
delivered WS. This article focuses on the first experimental results obtained on
the accurate modelisation of each individual performance metrics. Indeed, 19
generated models are provided, out of which 78.9% accurately represent the WS
performance metrics for two representative SaaS web services used for the
validation of the PRESENCE approach. This opens novel perspectives for assessing
the SLA compliance of Cloud providers using the PRESENCE framework

Developed by the A. A.Z.A Ibrahim in the context of his Ph.D thesis at the
University of Luxembourg (developped under the supervision of Dr. S. Varrette),
the 'Presence' projects aims at demonstrating the framework proposed in the
publications linked to this study.
